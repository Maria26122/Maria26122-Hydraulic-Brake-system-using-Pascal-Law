# Hydraulic Brake System Simulation using Pascal's Law 🚗💧

Welcome to the **Hydraulic Brake System Simulation**! This interactive project demonstrates the working of a hydraulic brake system based on **Pascal's Law** using Python, Pygame, and OpenGL.

---

## 📝 Description

This project visually simulates how force applied to a brake pedal is transmitted via hydraulic fluid to the brake pads, slowing down a car. It is designed for educational purposes to help you understand the principles of Pascal's Law and hydraulic systems.

---

## 📋 Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Pygame** (`pip install pygame`)
- **PyOpenGL** (`pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate`)
- (Optional) **NumPy** (`pip install numpy`) for advanced features

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Maria26122/Hydraulic-Brake-system-using-Pascal-Law.git
   cd Hydraulic-Brake-system-using-Pascal-Law
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the simulation:**
   ```bash
   python hydraulic_brake_simulation.py
   ```

---

## 🕹️ Interactive Controls

- **Press'F'**: Apply the brake pedal (see the system in action)
- **Press'R'**: Release the brake pedal (system returns to rest)
- **ESC key**: Exit the simulation window

---

## 🔍 Process Overview

1. **Initialization**: The simulation window opens with a car and hydraulic brake system diagram.
2. **User Input**: Press and hold the spacebar to apply the brake pedal.
3. **Simulation**: The force is transmitted through the hydraulic fluid, moving the brake pads and slowing the car.
4. **Visualization**: Watch the pistons, fluid, and car respond in real time.
